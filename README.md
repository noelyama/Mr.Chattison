## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
For the COGS 18 project, I have made a chatbox named Mr. Chattison that only recommends movies. Personally, I am really bad at choosing a movie to watch. Mr. Chattison will help with this decision process, randomly generating a movie based on a genre that is specified by the user. In order to get a movie recommendation, the user will have to explicitly ask Mr. Chattison for a movie recommendation. If the user wishes for furthur information on the movie, Mr. Chattison will also provide a link to a website that has information on the given movie.

#### Inspiration
I am very indecisive when it comes to choosing a movie to watch. I was inspired by my friend who is like my Mr. Chattison.

#### Technologies used
Python
